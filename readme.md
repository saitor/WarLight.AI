## Goals 

According to [Fizzer](https://www.warlight.net/blog/index.php/2016/02/the-warlight-ai-goes-open-source/), the main goals for a good WarLight AI are, in order:

1. Be fun to play against in single-player.
2. Be fast (donâ€™t consume a lot of CPU or memory).
3. Be good at defeating human players.
4. Be fun to play against in multi-player.
5. Be good at defeating other bots.
